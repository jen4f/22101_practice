# 22101_practice
I needed to test my self-taught Python skills and prepare for my MSc Bioinformatics course commencing September 2023.
Around February 2023, I decided to follow DTU's 22101 course, Introduction to Programming in Life Sciences Using Python.
I completed all the excercises by the 1st of April, working on them on and off for 53 days in total.

I also hope to use this as practice give me a solid foundation to attend the intermediary course, 22113 Unix and Python Programming for Bioinfomaticians, during my spring semester in 2024. 

There are 13 lectures in total. For each lecture, if it comes with two sets of exercises, then I made two Jupyter notebooks. One for the main excercise set, another for the extra practice set.

Please let me know if you find any bugs, or if you have any comments or suggestions for improvements!
I did not have access to the solutions, so parts of my code might be a bit sub-optimal.

All information came from the courses's public wiki:
https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22101/index.php/Programme

Some of the content, such as video lectures, may require logging into DTU inside. However, the majority of the excercises can be completed by any individual with access to the link above.

Huge thanks to the course creater, Peter Wad Sackett, for making the lecture slices, lecture videos, and the practice problems available online.
I plan to work on Roaslind problems to further practice and improve what I learnt through doing 22101's practice questions.
